## Features

- 💬 **AI Chatbot for DePaul**  
  Ask questions about classes, professors, departments, campus buildings, deadlines, and more.  
  Responses are friendly, short, and helpful — tailored for students.

- 🚇 **CTA Train Tracker**  
  Real-time arrivals for all CTA train lines.  
  Just select your current station — no need to guess which line is coming next.

- 🧠 **Smarter than ChatGPT** *(coming soon)*  
  We're scraping syllabi, academic calendars, and course pages to train the bot on actual DePaul info.  
  This makes it context-aware and more accurate than generic chatbots.

- 📚 **Class & Professor Comparison** *(planned)*  
  Pick a course and see which professors teach it, how students rate them, and what each teaching style is like.

- 🗺️ **Campus Navigation & Recommendations** *(planned)*  
  Building directions, nearby food spots, study lounges, and the best places to kill time between classes.

- 📅 **Academic Calendar Integration** *(planned)*  
  Never miss a drop deadline or exam week. The assistant will pull straight from DePaul’s calendar.
